This repository satisfies question 4 (Dice Roller).\
In this project, I referenced to a dice game called 10,000.\
The objective of the game is to get at least 10,000 and have the highest score.\
In this case, the user will just reach to greater than or equal to 10,000 and following the rules of the game.\
The following are required build files: index.html, index_design.css, and index_javascript.js\
I referred to the rules mentioned by CMU for this program (http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~flip/games/10000.html)\
